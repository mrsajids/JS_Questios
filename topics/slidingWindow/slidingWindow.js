/*
The Sliding Window Pattern is a technique used to reduce time complexity in problems that involve contiguous sequences — like subarrays or substrings.

Instead of recomputing results from scratch for every possible window (which gives you an O(n²) solution), you “slide” a window (a range of elements) over the data, updating the result in O(1) each time → overall O(n).

⚙️ When to Use Sliding Window
Use it when you are asked for:
✅ The maximum / minimum / average / sum of a subarray or substring.
✅ The longest / shortest substring with certain properties.
✅ Any problem involving contiguous elements (not random access).
