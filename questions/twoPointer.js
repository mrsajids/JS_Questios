/*
Pattern 2: Two Pointers Pattern
## The Two Pointers pattern involves using two variables (pointers) that iterate through a data structure (like an array or string) from different directions (or with different speeds) to solve problems efficiently — often in O(n) time instead of O(n²) ##
These pointers can:
Start from both ends (left/right)
Move in the same direction
Move at different speeds (fast/slow)

| Problem Type               | Example                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Pair sum                   | Find if two numbers add up to a target  |
| Removing duplicates        | From sorted arrays or strings           |
| Reverse / Palindrome check | Reverse string or check palindrome      |
| Move elements              | Move zeros, partition array, Dutch flag |
| Linked list cycles         | Detect cycle using slow/fast pointers   |
